This project involves training a Transformer model to generate poetry. The Text Project focused on Poem Generation navigates through a spectrum of NLP techniques, beginning with Text Classification and advancing through POS Tagging, showcasing the potential of AI to not only understand but also create content that resonates on a human level.

The project integrates various components:
•	Data Preparation: Reading, normalizing, tokenizing, and vectorizing the dataset.

•	Dataset Handling: Creating a custom dataset class for managing input sequences and padding.

•	Model Definition: Implementing a Transformer model with positional encoding.

•	Training: Implementing a training loop to optimize the model.

•	Inference: Generating new poems using the trained model and sampling technique.
